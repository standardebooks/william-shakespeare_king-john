									<span>Exterior form, outward accoutrement,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which, though I will not practise to deceive,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What woman-post is this? hath she no husband</span>

									<span>That will take pains to blow a horn before her?</span>
